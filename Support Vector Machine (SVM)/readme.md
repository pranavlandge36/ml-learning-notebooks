## Home Loan Prediction – SVM Pipeline

This project focuses on analyzing a home loan dataset and building a complete machine learning pipeline using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

The workflow emphasizes proper preprocessing, model tuning, and handling class imbalance.

### Key Learnings and Steps
- Data analysis and feature understanding
- Building a preprocessing pipeline with encoding and imputers
- Training an SVM classification model
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Integrating preprocessing and modeling using pipelines

### Model Performance
- **F1 Score:** 0.75

### Notes
This notebook was created as a learning and exploratory project to understand end-to-end machine learning pipelines and SVM-based classification.
