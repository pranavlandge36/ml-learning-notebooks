## Employee Attrition Prediction – Tree-Based Models

This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics employee attrition dataset and builds end-to-end machine learning pipelines using tree-based models.

The focus is on preprocessing, model comparison, and hyperparameter tuning for classification tasks.

### Key Learnings and Steps
- Data analysis and feature understanding
- Building a preprocessing pipeline with encoding and imputers
- Training and comparing multiple tree-based models:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Evaluating and comparing model performance across algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Integrating preprocessing and modeling using pipelines

### Notes
This is a learning and exploratory project aimed at understanding tree-based models and end-to-end machine learning workflows on a real-world HR dataset.
