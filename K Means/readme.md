## K-Means Clustering – Iris & Construction Permits Dataset

This project explores and applies K-Means clustering on two datasets: the Iris dataset and a country-level construction permits dataset.

The notebook focuses on understanding unsupervised learning concepts and the complete clustering workflow.

### Key Learnings and Steps
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Applying K-Means clustering
- Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k)
- Evaluating clustering performance using the Silhouette Score
- Visualizing how K-Means separates data points into clusters

### Notes
This is a learning and exploratory project aimed at building intuition around clustering and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
