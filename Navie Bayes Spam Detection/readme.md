## Email Spam Detection – Naive Bayes

This project focuses on building an email spam detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

The notebook covers text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training for binary text classification.

### Key Learnings and Steps
- Understanding the fundamentals of the Naive Bayes algorithm
- Text preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Tokenization
- Feature extraction using text vectorization techniques
- Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluating model performance on spam vs non-spam emails

### About Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, with the assumption that features are conditionally independent.  
Multinomial Naive Bayes is particularly well-suited for text classification tasks, where features represent word frequencies or counts.

### Notes
This is a learning and exploratory project aimed at understanding text classification and probabilistic machine learning models.
